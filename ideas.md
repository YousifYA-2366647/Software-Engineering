# Ideas overview

## Idea 1

Centralized platform for youth organisations to keep track of inventory, attendance, programs of activities, personal/medical information of members etc.

## Idea 2

Problem: companies that use external transportation services often receive transportation documents (e.g. weight notes, loading notes, delivery notes, invoices) in various formats and via different channels (email, physical copies) and in diffent formats (documents are not always standardized). Documents arrive per invoice rather than per transport, causing processing delays, information gaps, and increased error rates.

Solution:
Centralized platform for transport drivers to give in weights of the transport and other information that are directly shared with customers. This faster sharing of information can lead to faster processing and fewer errors.

## Idea 3

Platform for car sharing.

## Idea 4

AI assisted performance tracking for athletes, with the goal to lay out a roadmap for future performance improvements.

## Idea 5

Swipe-based book lending platform

## Idea 6

Application for students to check various things and to connect them to existing tools (myTimeTable, Printing site, Paynet, ...)

## Idea 7

Enviroment for collecting learning data from students to help development of learning pattern recognition AI

## Idea 8

Diet planner ai based on inputs

## Idea 9

route planner that shows all transport options/combinations and costs and recommendations. 
for example walk 5 minutes to take the bus that takes you to the car renting place that so you can drive to your favorite place in amsterdam. (cheapest option) 
take a taxi (most expensive option) 
take a bus to destination (recommended option)

## Idea 10

personal level upper that gives you everyday an assignment to complete to upgrade your "stats" in a domain or something. for example if you want to improve your strength it gives you daily an exercise etc or if you want to learn a programming language it gives you a coding task etc. duolingo lookalike but for everything. You see your current level in every domain and based on the task and your activities your level increases --> can be combined with idea 4 and 13 (solo leveling inspired) + Video game where character leveling is based on real life performance (running, lifting weights, studying etc.)

## Idea 11

Rogue-like dungeon crawler with character levels, challenges and power-ups you can attain before starting runs.
To Do if choose: add some interesting features to stand out from the 1000 existing dungeon crawlers. parrying for instance, or a magic system where different spells can interact to create stronger spells.

## Idea 12

AI driven system that generates adds and uploads them to platforms by sourcing and verifying images from the web.
